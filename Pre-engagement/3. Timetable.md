1. You need to plan everything with timetable (use GRANT charts (http://www.grantt.com/))
2. You will need to agreed upon with the client about what will happen, when and where.
3. if any time change during the engagement just inform the client.
4. Timetable should contain at least the following
	- Target(s)
	- Step in the process (format: text)
	- Source IP Address
	- Criticality of test (format: text)
	- Start (format: Date-time)
	- End (format: Date-time)

	--> The best practice is to create it in a spreadsheet to modify it a long of the engagement
	- _Critical_: Determine whether the tests you are going to conduct on that particular date will pose some risk of denial-of-service, system outage or data loss to the client.
