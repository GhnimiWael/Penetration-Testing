Goal != Scope
1. Try to understand the main __Goal__ of the client request: Is the reason the client is hiring you in the first place
	1. _First Question_: __why do you want to execute a Penetration test?__ This determine how you will deal with the entire _pre-engagement_ phase
		1.  Do not expect that clients know what (this is a standard business rules, that certainly applies here)


2. The scope of Engagement:
	- What you will have to (or be allowed to) test
	- Can be defined both logically and physically
		- Logical scope: for example, an entire department with the organization, an entire line of operations or even the whole organization
		- Physical scope: simple IP address, given servers (identified by IP address or name), domains, subdomains, autonomous system and so o.
			- _Question_: What you want to ask the client what you want to test -> internal (intranet.pentest.this) or external subdomains (email.pentest.this)
